1. Safe Area
    - when appbar is not used, text goes to the top and battery icons hide them, 
        so this is used to send child below that area

2. Maps and Routing 
    - We have multiple pages and to navigate between them we need Routing
    - Set of key and value pairs
    - home: Home()
        routes: {
      '/':(context)=>LoadingScreen(),
      '/home':(context)=>Home(),
      '/location':(context)=>SelectLocation(),
    },
    - '/' says the First screen and it is LoadingScreen.
    - Home() and '/' conflicts so remove the Home()
    - To override the starting screen '/', use initialRoute: '/home',instead of home:Home()

3. To click a button and move to next page, for a button,
    - onPressed: (){
        Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/location');
        },
             
4. Routing acts like a stack where different pages are pushed and popped.

5. Widget Lifecycle
    - initState() called only once when widget is created
    - Build() is triggered when we use setstate()
    - Dispose() when widget/state object is removed

6. Asynchronous
    - when a code will be executed in future.
    - others don't wait for this to be completed
    -  void getData(){
        Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3),(){
        print('Hello delayed 3 seconds');
        });
        print('Not delayed'); 
        }
    - Here after ru, not delayed will be printed and 5 seconds later of code executed, prints delay.

    - If two delayed are used, Now to make a little syncronous and wait the execution after one delayed 
        is executed, we use async and await.
    -  void getData() async {
        await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3),(){
            print('Hello delayed 3 seconds');
            });
            print('Not delayed'); 
        }
    - This awaits till await function is executed then not delayed is executed

 7. Http package is installed.

 8. get() function is used to get json data 
    -  void getData() async {  
        Response response= await get(Uri.parse('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')); 
        print(response.body);}
    - {"userId": 1,
        "id": 1,
        "title": "delectus aut autem",
        "completed": false
        }
    - We need to convert this json to a format which we can use, using dart:convert package.
    - Map data= jsonDecode(response.body); the decoded format will be a map.

9. PushReplacementNamed insted of pushing to the stack, it replaces the beneath page.

10.  Navigator.pushReplacementNamed(context,'/home',arguments: {
        'location':instance.location,
        'flag': instance.flag,
        'time': instance.time,
        });
    - The aruguments is used to access the data to the /home page.
11. In Home page
         Map data={};
        @override
        Widget build(BuildContext context) {
            data=ModalRoute.of(context)!.settings.arguments as Map

11. To add a spinner in loading page
    - Import package 'package:flutter_spinkit/flutter_spinkit.dart'
    - SpinKitCircle(
          color: Colors.black,
          size: 50.0,
        ),
